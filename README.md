### Hi, I'm Blair ðŸŒ±

- I primarily make software for the competitive community surrounding the indie fighting game [Rivals of Aether](https://rivalsofaether.com) and contribute to open source.
- Some technologies I've been enjoying recently are Python, Go, TypeScript + React, TailwindCSS, and Redis.
- Aspects of development I find particularly interesting include rendering strategies, UX, and accessibility.

I am currently seeking work! You can find my full project portfolio, resume, and contact info here: https://blair-c.github.io
